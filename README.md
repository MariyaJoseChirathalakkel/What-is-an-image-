# What-is-an-image-
An image can be considered as a two-dimensional array which is used to represent a 3D world on a 2D plane. Each element in the 2D  matrix represents a pixel that usually ranges from 0-1 or 0-255. In general, a pixel is composed of three colours mainly Red, Green and Blue (RGB).

The number of bits used in a pixel represents the depth of colour in an image. In order to determine the number of colours used in a pixel, it is determined in such a way that two to the power of the number of bits in the pixel.

For example, if an image contains one bit per pixel it has two colours and if an image contains 8 bits per pixel it has 256 colours. i,e 2 to the power 8.

The size of an image can be represented using the width and height of the image that is given in pixel. An image of size 1920 x 1080 can be considered as a high dimensional image.

For example, an image of size 1024 x 981 denotes that the image width is 1024 pixels and the image height is 981 pixels.
